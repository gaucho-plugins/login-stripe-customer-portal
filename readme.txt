Create a customer login endpoint URL for the Stripe Customer Portal directly from your WordPress site.

== Description ==

The **Login for Stripe Customer Portal** plugin simplifies the process for Stripe merchants to integrate the Stripe Customer Portal into their WordPress website. By offering a customizable login endpoint, this plugin makes it easy for customers to log in and access their Stripe billing information. The Customer Portal is still hosted on Stripe, but the Login page is on your domain, giving a bit more control. 

### Key Features:

* **Secure Authentication**: Users log in with their email to access their Stripe Customer Portal securely.
* **Redirect URL**: After logging out of the portal, customers are redirected back to a specified URL, which can be customized in the plugin settings.
